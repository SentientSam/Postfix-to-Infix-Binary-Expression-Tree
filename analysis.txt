Analyze the worst-case time complexity of the private member
function makeEmpty(BinaryNode* & t) of the binary expression tree.
Give the complexity in the form of Big-O. Your analysis can be informal;
however, it must be clearly understandable by others. Name the file
containing the complexity analysis as "analysis.txt".

The Big O analysis of the makeEmpty(BinaryNode* & t) function would be O(n).
This is because the function is recursively called by itself for every node inside the binary tree. 
This only has one step to it for each node, so the runtime is O(n).
